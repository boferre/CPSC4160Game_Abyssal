NOTES
- The two main helper class I've been using for this assignment is the player and animation files.
- My gameEngine class (Called Graphics within my files and code) has been split off from the main game loop.
	My thinking with this is that this would allow me to create a "Menu" class later on that would be
	seperated from the game loop.
- The Player Character works on a tank like controls. You use the left and right arrow keys to angle the ship
	and the Up and Down arrow keys will accelerate the ship. Each Up/Down button press will
	increase the velocity of the ship. In order to stop the ship, press the opposite arrow key
	and the ship will slow down till reaching a halt. I'm currently playing around with speeds variability. 
- The ship switches between 3 states: An Idle, Forward, and Backward. These are indicated via the movement
	and the animations that play. With Idle, the ships rear engine are a silver color. When moving, the
	rear engines turn a crimson color to simulate heated metal. Along with color change, bubbles will appear
	depending on the direction of the ship. I.E. Forward will have a trail of bubbles behind, while Backwards
	has a trail of bubbles in front.
- (BUG) I've setup a primitive scrolling effect, there's a couple bugs with this in terms of my boundary collision. If
	the ship is angled towards the boundary, it will vanish into the unknown and cannot be recovered.
